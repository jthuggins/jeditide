ChangeLog for the JExplorer plugin

VERSION 0.3.1 (2003.07.27)

- Updated for ProjectViewer 2.0.2, so that project files additions and removals,
  and project name changes can be correctly handled.

VERSION 0.3 (2003.06.29)

- The user can now choose to have a model automatically rebuilt when a buffer
  changes, or when it's saved, or never. This can be set independently for each
  model from the model "Properties" dialog.
- Models are no longer automatically rebuilt when such options change. Instead,
  a new "Update" button in the "Properties" dialog permits to reparse and build
  the model anytime.
- A "Rebuilding delay" ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 seconds can be set in the global
  options dialog. This determines how much time JExplorer must wait after the
  last keystroke before rebuilding the model when the "When buffers change"
  option in the "Properties" dialog is selected.
- Selection is now preserved even when a model can't be rebuilt due to errors.
  As soon as the model is successfully rebuilt, selection will be restored if the
  corresponding item still exists.
- Clicking upon an already selected item now positions the jEdit buffer upon the
  corresponding code each time. This previously happened only when selection
  actually changed.
- JExplorer's dockables do not flash anymore when a model is rebuilt.
- All icons now have 32 bpp depth, since 1, 2 and 4 bpp icons were incorrectly
  rendered on Linux. (Thanks to Dave Landers for his help).

VERSION 0.2.1 (2003.05.23)

- Besides libraries, "type-import-on-demand" imports resolution now includes
  project sources. This bug caused incorrect graph drawing due to unresolved
  references.
- Minor updates to documentation.

VERSION 0.2 (2003.05.15)

- The rendering colors for fields, constructors and methods can now be set,
  independently.
- The background color of the Graph window is now equal to the background color
  of standard Trees (was always white).
- When the "Show package colors" option is not active or an item does not have
  a matching package-color definition, the color of items in the Graph window and
  the color of package indicators in the Index window is now equal to the
  background color (was always white).
- The documentation is now more complete and a TOC has been added.
- The model selector combo box now shows a tooltip.
- Popup menus are now forced inside the screen boundaries.
- When multiple files are saved at once using jEdit's "Save All..." command, the
  corresponding model is now rebuilt only once (Thanks Slava).
- It isn't possible to open multiple instances of the "Models" dialog anymore.

VERSION 0.1 (2003.05.06)

- Initial release, for jEdit 4.1 final
